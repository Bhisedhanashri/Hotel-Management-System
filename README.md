The Hotel Management System is a console-based Java application designed to simulate the operations of a hotel. This project demonstrates the use of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts including Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.

Users can manage rooms, make bookings, cancel bookings, and view room details. The system supports different types of rooms such as SingleRoom, DoubleRoom, and SuiteRoom, each with unique behaviors.

Features

Room Management: Add and view rooms with different types.

Booking Management: Book or cancel rooms.

Room Types: Single, Double, and Suite rooms with different rates.

Polymorphic Behavior: Cost calculations and room information display vary per room type.

Encapsulation: Private fields with getters and setters to ensure data security.

Abstraction: Abstract Room class enforces implementation of core room behaviors in subclasses.

Transaction History (Optional Enhancement): Tracks bookings and payments.
